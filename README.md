# Project Euler Problem 25
## [Largest palindrome product](https://projecteuler.net/problem=25)



The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

    Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2, where F1 = 1 and F2 = 1.

Hence the first 12 terms will be:

    F1 = 1
    F2 = 1
    F3 = 2
    F4 = 3
    F5 = 5
    F6 = 8
    F7 = 13
    F8 = 21
    F9 = 34
    F10 = 55
    F11 = 89
    F12 = 144

The 12th term, F12, is the first term to contain three digits.

What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?

## Adding and Contributing Solutions

### First Clone the Repository

The easiest way to download the needed files is to clone the entire repository from your personal account. You will need to install [Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) for this. 

```
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/ProjectEuler-####.git
cd ProjectEuler-####
```

### Adding New Solution

To add a new solution, just create new folder in `ProjectEuler-####` and place your files there. If your solution is a mathematical right up, you can right it in a `README.md` file or post a write-up in LaTeX. If you choose LaTeX, make sure and post the source files, and not just the PDF. 

Now that you have added your solution locally, you need to push it to the main repository. 

```
git add ./*
git commit -a -m 'message explaining what you added'
git push
```


### Contribute to Existing Solutions

While anyone has the ability to modify existing files, it is best if you use GitHub's `issues` to discuss the changes with the original author before making any modifications. To modify the files, you only need to clone the repository, make changes, and then push your commits as above.
